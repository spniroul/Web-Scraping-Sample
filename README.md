<h1>Web-Scraping Sample</h1>
As a sample, I wrote a python script to scrape data from AEA website. The script aims to scrape available issue information. 

Similarly, specific article informations such as title, download links, author names, article classification, JEL Codes, and volume description have also been extracted.
The final data has been consolidated in a csv file.


<h4>Note: </h4>Please use the code wisely. A constant url request can increase the load for a server, therefore, it is necesary to scrape data without creating inconvenience for other users.
If possible, it is helpful to use API requests for retreiving online data. This script has been uploaded for web-scraping demonstration.
